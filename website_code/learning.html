      <h1>Rules Governing the Use of the Resource Services</h1>

      <section class="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          All students and staff of the College are entitled to register as
          members of the Learning Resources and to use the Learning Resources
          facilities for their course of study or College employment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Membership may also be extended to other individuals and persons
          nominated from other organisations: a fee is usually charged. Access
          to the Learning Resources for study purposes may be made available to
          non-members by arrangement. Details are available in the External
          Services leaflet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use of Learning Resources facilities implies acceptance of the
          Learning Resources rules printed below. These are designed to protect
          the interests of all Learning Resources users and ensure that the
          College operates within the law and can carry out its functions
          efficiently and effectively. The Learning Resources rules apply in
          principle to all Learning Resources sites, including workstation rooms
          and site libraries, notwithstanding some variations in practice in the
          site libraries. Admission to the Learning Resources is conditional
          upon observation of the rules and the staff of the Learning Resources
          are empowered to enforce them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Breaches of the rules may be dealt with by specific Learning Resources
          Disciplinary Action (see below), including the withdrawal of some or
          all Learning Resources facilities, and if appropriate by invoking the
          College’s Regulations for Students, in the case of students, or in the
          case of staff through the appropriate College procedures as set out in
          the Staff Handbook.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="rules">
        <h2>Rules</h2>

        <h3>A. Access:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The use of Learning Resources facilities is normally limited to use
            for the educational and other purposes of the College.
          </li>
          <li>
            All individuals wishing to become members of the Learning Resources
            must comply with the registration procedures. These include an
            undertaking to abide by Learning Resources rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            Individuals or organisations who are not eligible for membership but
            have good reason to use the Learning Resources may be admitted, by
            arrangement, for purposes of study only. Procedures for seeking
            admission are outlined in the External Services leaflet. Non-members
            must sign the Visitors' Book on each visit, and may be required to
            produce written identification. Study use does not include access to
            the College's Academic Network.
          </li>
          <li>
            ID cards issued by the College or Learning Resources are not
            transferable from one person to another. The person named on each
            card is responsible for all items borrowed on it and is liable for
            the cost of replacement of the card or items borrowed on it in the
            event of loss or damage. Users of the Learning Resources are
            reminded that they must be willing to show ID cards or other
            identification when requested to do so by College staff.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>B. Use of Facilities:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The Learning Resources is not responsible for loss of, or damage to,
            the personal belongings of its users and visitors. Users must take
            reasonable precautions against theft of their belongings, and must
            not leave belongings unattended even for a very short period. Study
            tables/PCs may not be reserved by depositing clothing or private
            property on the adjacent seat. Articles left unattended may be
            removed by Learning Resources staff but will be returned on request
            at the Reception Desk.
          </li>
          <li>
            All users are required to conduct themselves quietly throughout the
            Learning Resources and conversation between users must be kept to a
            minimum. No conversation is permitted in those parts of the Learning
            Resources designated as ‘Silent’ areas.
          </li>
          <li>Personal stereos may not be used in the Learning Resources.</li>
          <li>
            Mobile phones must be turned off in all Learning Resources study
            areas. Their use is permitted in the enclosed stair wells of the
            Main Site building. Circumstances at the Clinical Site Libraries may
            vary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users should not make use of mains electrical supplies to power
            their own equipment, including external storage devices, unless the
            equipment has been tested and confirmed as meeting the required
            Health & Safety standards. Written evidence of such compliance will
            be required.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eating and drinking are not permitted in any of the public areas of
            the Learning Resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Action will be taken against any person misusing furniture,
            facilities or materials. Any such person may be required to pay for
            the making good damage or loss.
          </li>
